# Inheritance Summary

## Introduction
Last week, I was introduced to a concept known as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). This programming paradigm is object-based and offers numerous benefits, including reusability, data redundancy, security, and more. This week, my focus was on a concept called inheritance, where one class is derived from another.

## Program Summary
In the code that I wrote, there is a base class called 'Person'. This class initializes the details of the person and includes getters, setters, and a few functions. Using inheritance, I created a class called 'Bodybuilder' that inherits the traits of 'Person' and adds its own functions for bulking up. Lastly, I created an abstract class called 'Gym' with virtual functions. These functions return different values based on the gym you attend.

## Summary
In summary, I created a base class called 'Person' and used it in another class called 'Bodybuilder' through inheritance. I also created an abstract class called 'Gym' with virtual functions to implement different weight gain and weight loss strategies based on the gym. This approach demonstrates the power and flexibility of inheritance in Object-Oriented Programming.
